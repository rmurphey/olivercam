# OliverCam

A little node ditty to take pictures and show them on a web page
that auto-updates via socket.io as new pictures are taken.

I wrote this to run on my Raspberry Pi. Note that it requires fswebcam
in order to work.

If you want to use this, you're on your own, but:

- `npm install` and stuff
- I was using Node 0.10.3
- You'll want to update the settings object in index.js
